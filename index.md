Welcome to my little corner on the web.

I'm a professional software engineer with 2 wonderful kids, a
[fluffy dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi), and
[amazing wife](http://www.livingprettyblog.com). I'm an American expat
residing in the sunny part of England, in West London.

I maintain a [blog](/blog).

### Professional experience

I've worked in finance, telecom, and media with a range of
technologies and languages. See my [curriculum vitae](/james-ravn.pdf)
and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/jsravn) for details.

### Projects

I've done various things outside of a professional setting. See my
[github account](https://github.com/jsravn) for the stuff I've managed
to make public.
